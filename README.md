# Project task
Develop a SPA that allows users to view and filter lists of items from a database. Use React and Redux to create the application's interface and manage its state. Interact with an API to retrieve and save data from the database.

- Create an application that consists of several components: a header, a search field, a list of items, and a form for adding a new item.
- Use React Router to create application routes that allow users to navigate between pages.
- Use Redux to manage the application's state. Create a reducer and actions that allow adding, deleting, and updating items.
- Create a component for the item list that retrieves data from the Redux store and displays it as a table with columns: ID, name, description, price, photo, rating, stock, category. Add the ability to sort and filter items by each column.
- Add a search field that allows users to search for items by name or category. The item list component should update automatically when the user enters a query in the search field.
- Create a form for adding a new item. Use Formik and Yup to validate the entered data.
- Add the ability to delete an item from the list and from the Redux store.
